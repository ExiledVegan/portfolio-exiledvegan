I've decided to start posting on my YouTube channel once again. I've always enjoyed creating video content, so now that I have the proper equipment I can make videos from time to time.

My current plan is to create EtherOrcs videos as much as possible and possibly expand on other projects if I ever get interested in playing more.

The NFT space is still young, so I'm sure there will be plenty more games to play as time goes on.
